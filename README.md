This is my first project developed in collaboration with a client who aimed to establish a new business focused on translation, editing, and subtitling services. Unfortunately, the client faced challenges and ultimately decided to discontinue the venture. Nonetheless, I completed the website as planned because I was committed to seeing the project through. I successfully published the site, showcasing my skills and dedication.
