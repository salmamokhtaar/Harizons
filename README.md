This is my first project, created in collaboration with a customer who wanted to establish a new business focused on translation, editing, and subtitling. Unfortunately, the customer faced challenges and could not continue. Despite this, I decided to complete and publish the website as planned.

I developed this project as a volunteer, without any financial compensation. My goal was to do my best, and I am proud of the outcome.
